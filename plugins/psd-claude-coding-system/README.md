## What Is This?

A unified Claude Code plugin combining **battle-tested development workflows** with **self-improving meta-learning**. Get immediate productivity gains from proven commands while the system learns your patterns and suggests improvements over time.

**One plugin. Two superpowers.**

1. **Workflow Automation** - 9 commands + 10 workflow specialist agents
2. **Meta-Learning** - 9 commands + 5 meta-learning agents that learn from your usage

## Automatic Telemetry (NEW in v1.1.0)

**Zero configuration required!** The system automatically tracks your usage via hooks:

### How It Works

Every time you run a command:
1. **UserPromptSubmit hook** detects slash command execution
2. **SubagentStop hook** tracks which agents were invoked
3. **Stop hook** records duration and success/failure
4. **Data written** to `meta/telemetry.json` automatically

### What Gets Tracked

‚úÖ **Collected** (privacy-safe):
- Command names (`/work`, `/test`, etc.)
- Duration (how long each took)
- Success/failure status
- Agents invoked
- File counts (not names or content)
- Test counts

‚ùå **NOT Collected:**
- Your actual code
- File names or paths
- Issue descriptions
- Personal information
- API keys or secrets

### Example Telemetry

```json
{
  "command": "/work",
  "duration_seconds": 720,
  "success": true,
  "agents_invoked": ["backend-specialist", "test-specialist"],
  "metadata": {
    "files_changed": 8,
    "tests_added": 12
  }
}
```

**Privacy**: All data stays local in `meta/` folder (git-ignored).

---

## Typical Usage Flow

### Week 1-2: Learn the Commands

```bash
# Work on features
/work 347

# Run tests
/test

# Handle reviews
/review_pr 123

# Clean up
/clean_branch
```

**Behind the scenes**: System quietly observes via hooks (you do nothing).

### Week 3: First Analysis

```bash
# See what patterns emerged
/meta_analyze

# Output example:
# - You ran /work 23 times (avg 18 min)
# - You always run /test after /work (92%)
# - Security bugs always involve auth/ directory
```

### Week 4: First Suggestions

```bash
# Get improvement ideas
/meta_learn

# Output example:
# SUGGESTION #1: Combine /work and /test
#   Confidence: 94%
#   Time savings: 5 min per task = 115 min/month
#   To apply: /meta_implement suggestion-1 --dry-run
```

### Month 2+: Weekly Improvements

```bash
# Monday morning routine (15 minutes)
/meta_improve

# System automatically:
# ‚úì Analyzes patterns
# ‚úì Generates suggestions
# ‚úì Auto-implements high-confidence improvements
# ‚úì Creates PR for your review
# ‚úì Evolves agents to be smarter

# You just review and merge the PR
gh pr merge <number>
```

**Result**: 15-40 hours saved monthly through compound improvements.

## Compound Engineering Principles

This system embodies compound engineering:
- Every bug ‚Üí prevention system
- Every manual process ‚Üí automation candidate
- Every solution ‚Üí template for similar problems
- Every workflow ‚Üí data for meta-learning

Use `/compound_concepts` to extract systematization opportunities.

## Installation

### From GitHub (Recommended)

```bash
/plugin marketplace add psd401/psd-claude-coding-system
/plugin install psd-claude-coding-system
```

### From Local Directory

```bash
/plugin marketplace add ~/path/to/psd-claude-coding-system
/plugin install psd-claude-coding-system
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
/plugin list
# Should show: psd-claude-coding-system (v1.1.0)

# Test a command
/meta_health
```

---

## What's New

### v1.1.1 (Bug Fix)

**CRITICAL FIX**: Telemetry hooks now work correctly!

- Fixed UserPromptSubmit hook field name (`prompt` not `user_prompt`)
- Commands are now properly tracked in telemetry.json
- All users should update to this version

### v1.1.0 (Major Release)

### Hook-Based Telemetry

Previously, commands had bash blocks trying to call telemetry functions. This was unreliable because Claude doesn't always execute bash blocks.

**Now**: Hooks automatically track commands via `hooks/hooks.json`:
- `SessionStart` - Initialize telemetry file
- `UserPromptSubmit` - Detect slash command execution
- `SubagentStop` - Track agent invocations
- `Stop` - Finalize and write telemetry entry

**Benefit**: 100% reliable telemetry collection without AI involvement.

### Unified Plugin

Previously: Two separate plugins (`psd-claude-workflow` + `psd-claude-meta-learning-system`)

**Now**: One plugin with everything:
- Simpler installation (one command)
- Unified versioning
- Tighter integration
- Less confusion

---

## Privacy & Security

**Local Only**:
- All data stays on your machine
- No external network requests
- Git-ignored by default

**Opt-Out Options**:

```bash
# Option 1: Just use workflow commands, no telemetry
# (Meta-learning won't work without data)

# Option 2: Clear data periodically
rm meta/telemetry.json
```

**View Your Data**:

```bash
# Check what's being collected
cat meta/telemetry.json | jq .

# Or use meta commands for readable reports
/meta_health --dashboard
```

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Implement a Feature

```bash
# Start work on issue #347
/work 347

# System automatically:
# ‚úì Fetches issue details
# ‚úì Creates feature branch from dev
# ‚úì Implements solution following project patterns
# ‚úì Invokes backend-specialist and test-specialist
# ‚úì Tracks telemetry: duration, agents used, files changed
```

### Example 2: Weekly Improvement

```bash
# After using the system for a month
/meta_improve

# Output:
# [1/9] Analyzing 127 events...
#   ‚úì Found 12 patterns
# [2/9] Generating suggestions...
#   ‚úì 3 high-confidence suggestions
# [3/9] Auto-implementing improvements...
#   ‚úì Parallel PR review agents (saves 15 hr/month)
#   ‚úì Auto-cleanup after refactoring (saves 2 hr/month)
# [4/9] Evolving agents...
#   ‚úì security-analyst v5: 95% success rate (+1%)
# [5/9] Creating PR...
#   ‚úì PR #462 created

# You review and merge
gh pr view 462
gh pr merge 462
```

## Troubleshooting

### Commands Not Working

```bash
# Check installation
/plugin list

# Reinstall if needed
/plugin uninstall psd-claude-coding-system
/plugin install psd-claude-coding-system
```

### No Telemetry Data

```bash
# Check system status
/meta_health

# If "Events: 0" after using commands:
# 1. Check hooks are installed
ls ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/psd-claude-coding-system/plugins/psd-claude-coding-system/hooks/

# 2. Check if jq is installed (required for JSON manipulation)
which jq
# If not: brew install jq (macOS) or apt install jq (Linux)

# 3. Check meta directory exists
ls ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/psd-claude-coding-system/plugins/psd-claude-coding-system/meta/
```

### No Patterns Detected

**Cause**: Not enough usage data yet.

**Solution**: Use commands for 2-4 weeks (need 20-30 executions minimum).

### Plugin Installation Issues

**"Plugin not found in any marketplace"**

This usually means Claude Code's plugin cache is stale or marketplace.json doesn't match the actual plugin structure.

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Force refresh the marketplace
cd ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/psd-claude-coding-system
git pull origin main

# 2. Retry installation
/plugin install psd-claude-coding-system
```

**If that doesn't work (Nuclear Option):**
```bash
# Exit Claude Code completely, then:
mv ~/.claude/plugins ~/.claude/plugins.backup
# Restart Claude Code, then:
/plugin marketplace add psd401/psd-claude-coding-system
/plugin install psd-claude-coding-system
```
