# System Architect Command

You are a command wrapper that gathers context and invokes the architect-specialist agent to perform architecture design.

**Architecture Context:** $ARGUMENTS

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Context Gathering

When given an issue number, gather complete context:

```bash
# Get COMPLETE issue context including all prior work
if [[ "$ARGUMENTS" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
  echo "=== Loading Issue #$ARGUMENTS with all context ==="
  gh issue view $ARGUMENTS
  echo -e "\n=== All Comments (PM requirements, research, etc.) ==="
  gh issue view $ARGUMENTS --comments

  # Analyze existing architecture
  echo -e "\n=== Existing Architecture Documentation ==="
  find . -name "*.md" -path "*/docs/*" -o -name "ARCHITECTURE.md" -o -name "CLAUDE.md" 2>/dev/null | head -10

  ISSUE_NUMBER=$ARGUMENTS
else
  # Topic-based architecture (no issue number)
  ISSUE_NUMBER=""
fi
```

This provides:
- Original requirements from product-manager
- Technical research from issue command
- Any other context added by team
- Existing architecture patterns

### Phase 2: Invoke Architecture Specialist

Now invoke the architect-specialist agent with all gathered context:

**Use the Task tool with:**
- `subagent_type`: "psd-claude-coding-system:architect-specialist"
- `description`: "Architecture design for issue #$ISSUE_NUMBER" or "Architecture design for: [topic]"
- `prompt`: Include the full context gathered above plus the original $ARGUMENTS

The agent will return a structured architecture design containing:
1. Executive Summary
2. Design Overview
3. Key Architectural Decisions
4. Component Breakdown
5. API Design (if applicable)
6. Data Model (if applicable)
7. Implementation Steps
8. Testing Strategy
9. Risk Assessment
10. Success Metrics

### Phase 3: Post to GitHub Issue

If an issue number was provided, add the architecture design as a comment:

```bash
if [ -n "$ISSUE_NUMBER" ]; then
  # Post architecture design to the issue
  gh issue comment $ISSUE_NUMBER --body "## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Design

[Paste the executive summary from architect-specialist]

### Key Decisions
[Paste key decisions]

### Implementation Plan
[Paste implementation steps]

### Full Architecture Design
[Paste complete design from architect-specialist, or link to documentation if very long]

*Generated by architect-specialist agent*"

  echo "‚úÖ Architecture design posted to issue #$ISSUE_NUMBER"
else
  # No issue number - just display the design
  echo "‚úÖ Architecture design completed"
fi
```

## Usage Examples

**With issue number:**
```bash
/architect 347
# Loads issue #347, invokes architect-specialist, posts design to issue
```

**With architecture topic:**
```bash
/architect "Design caching layer for API responses"
# Invokes architect-specialist with topic, displays design
```

## Notes

- This command is a thin wrapper around @agents/architect-specialist
- The agent contains all architecture expertise and patterns
- This command focuses on context gathering and GitHub integration
- For architecture design without GitHub integration, the agent can be invoked directly

Remember: Good architecture enables change. Design for the future, but build for today.
