# Meta Health Command

You are an elite systems analyst specializing in measuring compound engineering effectiveness. Your role is to aggregate data from all meta-learning systems, calculate health metrics, track trends, and generate comprehensive dashboards that demonstrate the system's self-improvement progress.

**Arguments**: $ARGUMENTS

## Overview

This command generates a comprehensive health dashboard by analyzing:
- Telemetry data (`meta/telemetry.json`)
- Compound history (`meta/compound_history.json`)
- Experiments tracking (`meta/experiments.json`)
- Agent variants (`meta/agent_variants.json`)
- Workflow graphs (`meta/workflow_graph.json`)

**Key Metrics Tracked**:
1. **Compound Engineering Metrics**: Auto-improvements, success rates, bugs prevented
2. **Developer Velocity**: Current vs baseline, time saved, projections
3. **System Intelligence**: Agent evolution, workflow optimizations, patterns documented
4. **Code Quality**: Test coverage, technical debt, documentation accuracy
5. **Active Experiments**: Running trials, completed deployments
6. **Predictions Status**: High-confidence alerts, validated predictions
7. **ROI Summary**: Investment vs returns, compound multiplier

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Parse Arguments and Locate Data Files

```bash
# Find plugin directory (dynamic path discovery, no hardcoded paths)
META_PLUGIN_DIR="$HOME/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/psd-claude-coding-system/plugins/psd-claude-meta-learning-system"
META_DIR="$META_PLUGIN_DIR/meta"

# Data files
TELEMETRY_FILE="$META_DIR/telemetry.json"
HISTORY_FILE="$META_DIR/compound_history.json"
EXPERIMENTS_FILE="$META_DIR/experiments.json"
VARIANTS_FILE="$META_DIR/agent_variants.json"
WORKFLOW_FILE="$META_DIR/workflow_graph.json"

# Parse arguments
PUBLISH=false
SEND_EMAIL=false
OUTPUT_FILE=""

for arg in $ARGUMENTS; do
  case $arg in
    --publish)
      PUBLISH=true
      ;;
    --send-summary-email)
      SEND_EMAIL=true
      ;;
    --output)
      shift
      OUTPUT_FILE="$1"
      ;;
  esac
done

echo "=== PSD Meta-Learning: System Health Dashboard ==="
echo "Data sources:"
echo "  • Telemetry: $TELEMETRY_FILE"
echo "  • History: $HISTORY_FILE"
echo "  • Experiments: $EXPERIMENTS_FILE"
echo "  • Agent variants: $VARIANTS_FILE"
echo "  • Workflows: $WORKFLOW_FILE"
echo ""
echo "Options:"
echo "  • Publish: $PUBLISH"
echo "  • Send email: $SEND_EMAIL"
echo ""

# Verify required files exist
MISSING=0
for file in "$TELEMETRY_FILE" "$HISTORY_FILE"; do
  if [ ! -f "$file" ]; then
    echo "⚠️  Warning: $file not found"
    MISSING=$((MISSING + 1))
  fi
done

if [ $MISSING -gt 0 ]; then
  echo ""
  echo "⚠️  Some data files are missing. Dashboard will be limited."
  echo ""
fi
```

### Phase 2: Read All Data Sources

Use the Read tool to load all meta-learning data:

```bash
echo "Loading telemetry data..."
if [ -f "$TELEMETRY_FILE" ]; then
  cat "$TELEMETRY_FILE"
else
  echo '{"version": "1.0.0", "executions": [], "patterns": {}}'
fi

echo ""
echo "Loading compound history..."
if [ -f "$HISTORY_FILE" ]; then
  cat "$HISTORY_FILE"
else
  echo '{"version": "1.0.0", "suggestions": [], "implemented": []}'
fi

echo ""
echo "Loading experiments..."
if [ -f "$EXPERIMENTS_FILE" ]; then
  cat "$EXPERIMENTS_FILE"
else
  echo '{"experiments": []}'
fi

echo ""
echo "Loading agent variants..."
if [ -f "$VARIANTS_FILE" ]; then
  cat "$VARIANTS_FILE"
else
  echo '{"agents": []}'
fi

echo ""
echo "Loading workflow graph..."
if [ -f "$WORKFLOW_FILE" ]; then
  cat "$WORKFLOW_FILE"
else
  echo '{"learned_patterns": {}}'
fi
```

### Phase 3: Calculate Health Metrics

Using extended thinking, aggregate and analyze all data:

#### Metrics to Calculate

**1. Compound Engineering Metrics**:
- **Auto-Improvements Implemented**: Count from compound_history where status="implemented"
- **Manual Reviews Required**: Count where status="pending" and needs_review=true
- **Improvement Success Rate**: implemented / (implemented + rejected)
- **Bugs Prevented**: Sum of prevented incidents from telemetry/history
- **Trend**: Compare this month vs last month (if historical data available)

**2. Developer Velocity**:
- **Baseline Velocity**: 1.0x (pre-meta-learning reference)
- **Current Velocity**: Calculate from time_saved vs baseline_time
  - Formula: 1 + (total_time_saved / total_baseline_time)
- **Time Saved This Month**: Sum duration improvements from implemented suggestions
- **Projected Annual Savings**: time_saved_this_month × 12

**3. System Intelligence**:
- **Agent Evolution Generations**: Max generation number from agent_variants
- **Best Agent Improvement**: Compare v1 vs current version success rates
  - Example: security-analyst v4 at 0.94 vs v1 at 0.82 = +35% improvement
- **Workflow Optimizations Learned**: Count patterns in workflow_graph
- **Patterns Auto-Documented**: Count unique patterns from all sources

**4. Code Quality**:
- **Test Coverage**: Extract from telemetry (if tracked)
- **Technical Debt**: Calculate trend from code metrics
- **Documentation Accuracy**: From validation checks (if available)
- **Security Issues Caught Pre-Prod**: From security-analyst invocations

**5. Active Experiments**:
- **Running**: experiments where status="running"
  - Show: trial count, metrics, improvement percentage
- **Completed & Deployed**: experiments where status="deployed"
  - Show: outcome, ROI achieved

**6. Predictions Status**:
- **High Confidence Alerts**: From meta_predict or patterns
- **Predictions Validated**: Past predictions that came true
  - Track accuracy over time

**7. ROI Summary**:
- **Investment**:
  - Initial setup: estimate from first commit/start date
  - Ongoing maintenance: hours per month
- **Returns**:
  - Time saved: aggregate from all sources
  - Bugs prevented: value estimate
  - Knowledge captured: pattern count
- **Compound ROI**: Returns / Investment ratio

### Phase 4: Generate Health Dashboard

## Dashboard Generation Guidelines

### Data Aggregation Best Practices

**DO**:
- Calculate actual metrics from real data (don't estimate)
- Show trends with visual indicators (▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█, ↑↓, 🟢🟡🔴)
- Compare current vs baseline vs target
- Include confidence levels for predictions
- Provide actionable recommendations
- Track ROI with concrete numbers

**DON'T**:
- Show vanity metrics without context
- Include data without trends
- Make claims without evidence
- Overwhelm with too many metrics
- Ignore negative trends
- Present data without interpretation

### Handling Missing or Insufficient Data

If data is limited, clearly indicate:

```markdown
## 📊 LIMITED DATA AVAILABLE

**Current Status**:
- System age: [N] days (minimum 30 days recommended for trends)
- Executions: [N] (minimum 50+ for statistics)
- Data completeness: [percentage]%

**Available Metrics** (limited confidence):
[Show what metrics can be calculated]

**Unavailable Metrics** (insufficient data):
- Agent evolution (needs 3+ generations)
- Trend analysis (needs 30+ days)
- ROI accuracy (needs completed suggestions)

**Recommendation**:
Continue using the system for [N] more days to enable full dashboard.

**Preliminary Health**: [Basic metrics available]
```

### Trend Visualization

Use ASCII charts for quick visual trends:

```
Velocity over 12 weeks:
1.0x ████████
1.2x ██████████
1.5x ████████████
1.8x ██████████████
2.3x ██████████████████

ROI Compound Growth:
Month 1: ▁ 0.5x
Month 2: ▃ 1.8x
Month 3: ▅ 4.2x
Month 6: █ 9.4x
```

### Health Score Calculation

**Formula**: Sum of weighted sub-scores

- **Velocity** (20 points): Based on time_saved and productivity increase
  - 1.0-1.5x = 10 pts
  - 1.5-2.0x = 15 pts
  - 2.0x+ = 20 pts

- **Quality** (20 points): Based on test coverage, tech debt, security
  - Each metric contributes 5-7 pts

- **Intelligence** (20 points): Based on agent evolution and patterns learned
  - Agent improvement avg >20% = 15+ pts
  - Patterns documented >50 = 15+ pts

- **ROI** (20 points): Based on compound multiplier
  - 2-5x = 10 pts
  - 5-10x = 15 pts
  - 10x+ = 20 pts

- **Trend** (20 points): Based on direction of key metrics
  - All improving = 20 pts
  - Mixed = 10-15 pts
  - Declining = 0-10 pts

**Total**: 0-100 points
- 80-100: 🟢 Excellent
- 60-79: 🟡 Good
- 40-59: 🟡 Needs Improvement
- <40: 🔴 Critical

## Important Notes

1. **Accuracy**: All metrics must be based on actual data, never invented
2. **Trends**: Show direction and magnitude of change
3. **Context**: Always provide baseline and target for comparison
4. **Actionable**: Include specific recommendations based on data
5. **Honest**: Don't hide negative trends or problems
6. **Visual**: Use symbols and charts for quick scanning
7. **Regular**: Dashboard should be generated weekly or daily for trends

## Example Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Daily Health Check
```bash
/meta_health
```
Quick health overview in terminal.

### Scenario 2: Weekly Dashboard Publication
```bash
/meta_health --publish --output meta/health-$(date +%Y%m%d).md
```
Save dashboard and publish to docs.

### Scenario 3: Monthly Stakeholder Report
```bash
/meta_health --publish --send-summary-email
```
Full dashboard with email summary to stakeholders.
