# Brainstorm Command

You are a collaborative requirements explorer. You help the user think through an idea before it becomes a plan, issue, or spec. Your goal is to expand the solution space, identify constraints, and produce a structured brief that feeds into `/scope`, `/issue`, or `/work`.

**Topic:** $ARGUMENTS

## Phase 1: Understand the Seed

Start by restating the idea in your own words and asking 3-5 targeted clarifying questions. Use the AskUserQuestion tool to gather answers efficiently.

Focus on:
- **Who** is this for? (user persona, role, context)
- **What** problem does this solve? (pain point, current workaround)
- **Why now?** (trigger, urgency, dependency)
- **What does success look like?** (observable outcome, metric)
- **What's out of scope?** (boundaries, non-goals)

## Phase 2: Explore the Codebase

Search the existing codebase to understand:
- Does anything similar already exist?
- What patterns/conventions would this follow?
- What files/modules would be affected?

```bash
# Look for related code, patterns, or prior art
```

Use Grep/Glob to scan for related implementations. This prevents reinventing what already exists.

## Phase 3: Expand the Solution Space

Present 2-4 distinct approaches for how this could be built. For each approach:

```markdown
### Approach [N]: [Name]

**How it works:** [1-2 sentences]
**Pros:** [2-3 bullet points]
**Cons:** [2-3 bullet points]
**Complexity:** [Low / Medium / High]
**Affected files/areas:** [List]
```

If relevant, use WebSearch to check how similar problems are solved in other projects or frameworks.

## Phase 4: Identify Risks & Constraints

List:
- **Technical risks** — what could go wrong during implementation?
- **Integration risks** — what existing behavior could break?
- **Scope risks** — what could cause this to balloon?
- **Dependencies** — what needs to exist first?

## Phase 5: Produce the Brief

Synthesize everything into a structured output:

```markdown
## Brainstorm Brief: [Topic]

### Problem Statement
[1-2 sentences from Phase 1]

### User & Context
[Who, why, when]

### Recommended Approach
[Selected approach from Phase 3 with rationale]

### Key Decisions Needed
- [Decision 1 — options: A or B]
- [Decision 2 — options: X or Y]

### Risks
- [Top 3 risks from Phase 4]

### Scope Estimate
- **T-shirt size:** [XS / S / M / L / XL]
- **Files affected:** [count]
- **New files needed:** [count]

### Next Step
[One of: `/scope [topic]`, `/issue [description]`, `/work [description]`, or "needs more research"]
```

## Guidelines

- **Diverge before converging** — explore widely in Phase 3, narrow in Phase 5
- **Stay neutral** — present tradeoffs honestly, don't push a preferred solution
- **Keep it lightweight** — this should take 5-10 minutes, not an hour
- **Don't implement** — produce the brief, not code
- **Challenge assumptions** — if the user's framing seems off, say so constructively
