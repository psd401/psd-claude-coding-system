# Meta Predict Command

You are an elite predictive analyst with expertise in time-series analysis, pattern recognition, and proactive risk management. Your role is to analyze historical trends, detect emerging patterns, and predict future issues before they occur, enabling preventive action that saves debugging time and prevents incidents.

**Arguments**: $ARGUMENTS

## Overview

This command predicts future issues by analyzing:

**Analysis Dimensions**:
1. **Code Churn Patterns**: Files changing too frequently → refactoring candidate
2. **Bug Clustering**: Similar bugs in short time → systematic gap
3. **Technical Debt Accumulation**: Complexity growing → cleanup needed
4. **Architecture Drift**: New code not following patterns → need guardrails
5. **Performance Degradation**: Metrics trending down → investigation needed
6. **Security Vulnerability Patterns**: Code patterns similar to past incidents

**Predictive Model**:
- Historical Data: Telemetry + commit history + issue tracker
- Features: Code churn, bug types, component age, test coverage, review patterns
- Algorithm: Time-series analysis + pattern matching
- Confidence: Based on similar past patterns and statistical strength

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Parse Arguments and Load Historical Data

```bash
# Parse arguments
HORIZON="3m"  # 3 months prediction window
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD="0.70"
OUTPUT_FILE=""

for arg in $ARGUMENTS; do
  case $arg in
    --horizon)
      shift
      HORIZON="$1"
      ;;
    --confidence-threshold)
      shift
      CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD="$1"
      ;;
    --output)
      shift
      OUTPUT_FILE="$1"
      ;;
  esac
done

echo "=== PSD Meta-Learning: Predictive Analysis ==="
echo "Prediction horizon: $HORIZON"
echo "Confidence threshold: $CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD"
echo ""

# Load historical data (dynamic path discovery, no hardcoded paths)
META_PLUGIN_DIR="$HOME/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/psd-claude-coding-system/plugins/psd-claude-meta-learning-system"
META_DIR="$META_PLUGIN_DIR/meta"
TELEMETRY_FILE="$META_DIR/telemetry.json"
HISTORY_FILE="$META_DIR/compound_history.json"

echo "Loading historical data..."
if [ -f "$TELEMETRY_FILE" ]; then
  cat "$TELEMETRY_FILE"
else
  echo "⚠️  No telemetry data found"
  echo "Predictions will be based on git history only"
fi
```

### Phase 2: Analyze Trends

Using extended thinking, analyze multiple dimensions:

#### 1. Code Churn Analysis

```bash
echo ""
echo "Analyzing code churn patterns..."

# Get file change frequency over last 6 months
git log --since="6 months ago" --name-only --pretty=format: | \
  sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20

# Detect files changed >20 times (high churn)
# These are refactoring candidates
```

**High Churn Detection**:
```markdown
**Pattern**: auth/login.ts changed 47 times in 6 months (7.8x/month)
**Baseline**: Average file changes 2.3x/month
**Analysis**: 3.4x above average → refactoring candidate
**Probability**: 78% likely to cause bugs within 3 months
**Evidence**:
  - Issue #213 (auth bypass) occurred after 12 rapid changes
  - Issue #58 (similar pattern) in different module
  - Code complexity increased 65% vs 6 months ago
```

#### 2. Bug Clustering Analysis

```bash
echo "Analyzing bug patterns..."

# Extract bugs from git history
git log --grep="fix" --grep="bug" --since="6 months ago" --oneline

# Group by type/component
# Detect clusters of similar bugs
```

**Bug Clustering Detection**:
```markdown
**Pattern**: UTF-8/encoding bugs occurred 3 times in 6 months
**Frequency**: 0.5 bugs/month average
**Trend**: Increasing (0 → 1 → 2 in last 3 months)
**Probability**: 67% another UTF-8 bug within 2 months
**Evidence**:
  - Issue #347: Null bytes in document processing
  - Issue #289: Invalid UTF-8 in file uploads
  - Issue #156: Encoding issues in email system
**Pattern**: All involve user input → database storage
```

#### 3. Technical Debt Analysis

```bash
echo "Analyzing technical debt accumulation..."

# Measure code complexity trends
# Count TODO comments growth
# Detect unused code
# Check test coverage changes
```

**Technical Debt Detection**:
```markdown
**Metric**: Code complexity (cyclomatic)
**Current**: 18.7 avg per function
**6 months ago**: 14.2 avg per function
**Trend**: +31.7% (↑ 0.75/month linear)
**Projection**: Will reach 21.0 by 3 months (critical threshold)
**Probability**: 82% requires major refactoring within 6 months
**Cost if not addressed**: 40-80 hours refactoring work
```

#### 4. Architecture Drift Analysis

```bash
echo "Detecting architecture drift..."

# Check new code follows established patterns
# Detect violations of documented patterns
# Measure consistency with architecture
```

**Architecture Drift Detection**:
```markdown
**Pattern**: New API endpoints not following RESTful conventions
**Violations**: 7 out of last 12 endpoints (58%)
**Baseline**: Was 12% violation rate 6 months ago
**Trend**: Rapidly increasing
**Probability**: 73% architecture documentation becomes obsolete within 6 months
**Impact**: New developers confused, inconsistent codebase
```

#### 5. Performance Degradation Analysis

```bash
echo "Analyzing performance trends..."

# Extract performance metrics from telemetry
# Calculate trend lines
# Project future performance
```

**Performance Degradation Detection**:
```markdown
**Metric**: API latency (p95)
**Current**: 420ms
**6 months ago**: 280ms
**Trend**: +23ms/month linear increase
**Projection**: Will reach 600ms in 8 months (SLA threshold)
**Probability**: 67% requires optimization within 6-8 weeks
**Root Cause Analysis**:
  - Database queries: +15% growth per month
  - N+1 patterns detected in 3 recent PRs
  - Missing indexes on new tables
```

#### 6. Security Vulnerability Pattern Analysis

```bash
echo "Analyzing security patterns..."

# Compare current code patterns to past incidents
# Detect similar vulnerability patterns
# Check security review coverage
```

**Security Risk Detection**:
```markdown
**Pattern**: Auth code changes without security review
**Current State**:
  - Auth code touched in 7 PRs last month (3x normal rate)
  - 4 PRs merged without security-analyst review (57% vs baseline 12%)
  - Code complexity in auth module increased 45%
**Similar Past Incident**: Issue #213 (June 2024 auth bypass)
  - Pattern: 8 PRs without security review → auth bypass bug
  - Cost: 60 hours debugging + 4 hour outage
**Probability**: 82% auth security incident within 3 months
**Confidence**: High (based on 15 similar historical patterns)
```

### Phase 3: Generate Predictions

```

## Prediction Guidelines

### Confidence Levels

**High Confidence (>80%)**:
- Pattern matches ≥3 historical incidents exactly
- Risk factors all present and trending worse
- Statistical significance in trend data
- Generate specific preventive action plan

**Medium Confidence (60-79%)**:
- Pattern similar to 1-2 past incidents
- Some risk factors present
- Moderate statistical evidence
- Suggest investigation and monitoring

**Low Confidence (<60%)**:
- Weak signals or insufficient historical data
- No clear precedent
- Mention as potential area to watch
- Don't generate high-priority alerts

### Predictive Model Improvement

**How Predictions Improve Over Time**:
- **Month 1**: Simple heuristics (70% accuracy)
- **Month 3**: Pattern matching on history (80% accuracy)
- **Month 6**: Time-series analysis (85% accuracy)
- **Month 12**: Ensemble model with confidence intervals (90% accuracy)

**Learning Mechanisms**:
- Track prediction outcomes
- Adjust confidence based on accuracy
- Refine pattern matching rules
- Incorporate new incident types
- Cross-project learning

## Important Notes

1. **False Positives Are OK**: Better to prevent than miss
2. **Track Accuracy**: Measure predictions vs outcomes
3. **Actionable Only**: Don't predict without preventive actions
4. **ROI Focus**: Cost of prevention vs cost of incident
5. **Update Monthly**: Fresh predictions with new data
6. **Share Widely**: Make predictions visible to team

## Example Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Monthly Prediction Review
```bash
/meta_predict --horizon 3m --output meta/monthly-predictions.md
```

### Scenario 2: High-Confidence Only
```bash
/meta_predict --confidence-threshold 0.80
```

### Scenario 3: Long-Term Strategic Planning
```bash
/meta_predict --horizon 12m --output meta/annual-forecast.md
```

name: meta_predict

**Remember**: The best prediction is one that prevents an incident from happening. Prediction without prevention is just fortune-telling. Track accuracy to improve the model over time.
