## Introduction

### What Is This?

The **PSD Claude Meta-Learning System** is a plugin that watches how you develop software and automatically suggests ways to improve your workflow. Think of it as having an experienced developer looking over your shoulder, noticing patterns in your work, and saying "Hey, I've noticed you do X every time you do Y—let me automate that for you."

Unlike traditional development tools that stay the same forever, **this system improves itself based on how you actually work**.

### Why Should I Care?

**Real Benefits You'll See:**

- ⏱️ **Save 15-40 hours per month** through automated workflow improvements
- 🐛 **Prevent bugs before they happen** by learning from past mistakes
- 🧹 **Automatically clean up dead code** without manual searching
- 📝 **Keep documentation current** without extra effort
- 🚀 **Get faster over time** as the system learns your patterns

**Example**: After you fix 3 similar authentication bugs, the system will:
1. Notice the pattern
2. Suggest creating an automated security check
3. Generate the code for you
4. Test it on past issues
5. Apply it automatically (with your approval)

### Is This For Me?

**You'll benefit from this plugin if you:**
- ✅ Use Claude Code regularly (at least a few times per week)
- ✅ Want to work more efficiently
- ✅ Are curious about AI that improves itself
- ✅ Don't mind trying experimental features
- ✅ Work on projects with recurring patterns

**Don't worry if you're new to:**
- Meta-learning concepts (we'll explain everything)
- Advanced AI workflows (designed for beginners)
- The psd-claude-workflow plugin (works standalone or together)

## Core Concepts Made Simple

### What Is "Meta-Learning"?

**Simple Answer**: Learning how to learn better.

**Analogy**: Imagine you're learning to play piano. Regular learning is practicing scales. **Meta-learning** is noticing that you learn faster when you practice right after breakfast, so you adjust your schedule. The system doesn't just help you code—it learns the best ways to help you.

**In Practice**:
- Week 1: You run `/work` command 10 times
- Week 2: System notices you always run `/test` right after `/work`
- Week 3: System suggests: "Create a `/work_and_test` command to save 3 minutes each time"
- Week 4: You approve, system implements it
- **Result**: From then on, you save 3 min × 10 times/month = 30 minutes monthly

### What Is Telemetry?

**Simple Answer**: A record of what commands you run and how long they take.

**What We Collect** (stored locally on your machine):
- ✅ Command names (`/work`, `/test`, etc.)
- ✅ How long each command took
- ✅ Whether it succeeded or failed
- ✅ Which AI agents were used
- ✅ How many files were changed

**What We DON'T Collect**:
- ❌ Your actual code
- ❌ Issue descriptions or details
- ❌ Personal information
- ❌ API keys or secrets
- ❌ Anything sent to external servers

**Privacy**: All data stays on your computer in the `meta/` folder and is **Git-ignored by default**.

### How Does Self-Improvement Work?

The system follows a continuous cycle:

```
1. OBSERVE → 2. ANALYZE → 3. LEARN → 4. SUGGEST → 5. IMPLEMENT → 6. REPEAT
    ↑                                                                    ↓
    └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Real Example**:

1. **OBSERVE**: You fix UTF-8 encoding bugs 3 times in 2 months
2. **ANALYZE**: System detects pattern: "Text from PDFs → Database → Null byte errors"
3. **LEARN**: "Need validation at the database boundary"
4. **SUGGEST**: "Add UTF-8 sanitizer + tests" (with generated code)
5. **IMPLEMENT**: You review and approve → System applies it
6. **REPEAT**: Next time similar code is written, system prevents the bug

### What Are "Agents"?

**Simple Answer**: Specialized AI assistants that are experts at specific tasks.

**Analogy**: Like having a team of specialists:
- 🎯 **Meta-Orchestrator**: The project manager who assigns work to the right specialist
- 🧹 **Code Cleanup Specialist**: The organizer who removes clutter
- 💬 **PR Review Responder**: The communicator who handles feedback
- ✅ **Document Validator**: The quality checker who catches data errors
- ⚠️ **Breaking Change Validator**: The safety inspector who prevents accidents

**How They Work Together**: When you ask to delete old code, the Breaking Change Validator checks if anything uses it, the Code Cleanup Specialist finds related dead code, and the Meta-Orchestrator coordinates their work.

### Key Terminology

| Term | Simple Definition | Example |
|------|------------------|---------|
| **Telemetry** | Record of your development activity | "Ran `/work` 5 times today, avg 12 min each" |
| **Pattern** | Repeated behavior the system notices | "You always test after refactoring" |
| **Suggestion** | Improvement the system recommends | "Auto-run tests after refactor commands" |
| **Compound Engineering** | Turning every problem into a system improvement | Bug → Fix → Prevention → Documentation → Test |
| **Agent** | Specialized AI assistant | Breaking Change Validator checks before deletions |
| **Workflow Graph** | Map of which agents work well together | "Security bugs need security-analyst + test-specialist" |

## How It Works

### The Learning Cycle (Step-by-Step)

Let's walk through what happens behind the scenes:

#### Phase 1: Observation (Automatic)

**What Happens**: Every time you run a command, the system quietly records it.

**Example**:
```
You run: /work 347
System logs:
  {
    "command": "/work",
    "issue": 347,
    "started": "2025-10-20 10:00:00",
    "duration": 720 seconds (12 minutes),
    "success": true,
    "agents_used": ["backend-specialist", "test-specialist"],
    "files_changed": 8
  }
```

**Your Action**: Nothing! Just use Claude Code normally.

#### Phase 2: Pattern Recognition (Weekly)

**What Happens**: System analyzes all recorded data to find patterns.

**Example Patterns Detected**:
- "User runs `/test` within 5 minutes of `/work` 92% of the time"
- "Security bugs always involve the `auth/` directory"
- "Refactoring tasks take 3x longer without the code-cleanup-specialist"

**Your Action**: Run `/meta_analyze` weekly to see what patterns were found.

#### Phase 3: Learning (Weekly/Monthly)

**What Happens**: System generates specific improvement suggestions.

**Example Suggestion**:
```markdown
SUGGESTION #1: Combine /work and /test commands
→ COMPOUND BENEFIT: Saves 3-5 minutes per task
→ CONFIDENCE: High (95%) - Based on 23 similar tasks
→ ESTIMATED ROI: 15 hours/month saved
→ IMPLEMENTATION: Auto-generated code ready
→ TO APPLY: /meta_implement suggestion-1 --dry-run
```

**Your Action**: Review suggestions via `/meta_learn`, approve good ones.

#### Phase 4: Implementation (On Demand)

**What Happens**: System applies approved improvements with safety checks.

**Example**:
1. You run: `/meta_implement suggestion-1 --dry-run`
2. System shows what would change (no actual changes)
3. You review the plan
4. You run: `/meta_implement suggestion-1` to apply
5. System creates a PR for you to review
6. You merge → Improvement is live

**Your Action**: Review and approve implementations.

#### Phase 5: Evolution (Monthly)

**What Happens**: AI agents improve themselves using genetic algorithms.

**Example**:
- **Month 1**: Security agent finds 3.2 issues per review (baseline)
- **Month 2**: System creates 5 variations of the security agent
- **Month 3**: Tests each on past issues, best variant finds 4.7 issues
- **Month 4**: Promotes best variant (47% improvement!)

**Your Action**: Run `/meta_evolve` monthly, review results.

#### Phase 6: Prediction (Ongoing)

**What Happens**: System predicts problems before they occur.

**Example Prediction**:
```markdown
⚠️ PREDICTION: Authentication security incident likely (82% confidence)
→ EVIDENCE: Auth code changed 7 times last month without security review
→ SIMILAR PATTERN: Issue #213 (June 2024) had same pattern
→ PREVENTIVE ACTIONS:
  1. [AUTO] Add security gate to auth code changes
  2. [PENDING] Schedule security audit
→ COST IF NOT PREVENTED: 40-80 hours debugging + 2-4 hour outage
→ PREVENTION COST: 8 hours (ROI = 5-10x)
```

**Your Action**: Review `/meta_predict` monthly, act on high-confidence predictions.

## TELEMETRY ANALYSIS - October 20, 2025

### Activity Summary
- **Commands Executed**: 127 (this week)
- **Most Used**: /work (35%), /review_pr (22%), /test (18%)
- **Total Time**: 42.5 hours of development
- **Avg Time Saved**: 12.3 hours/week (vs manual workflow)

### Patterns Detected

#### PATTERN #1: Sequential Command Chains
**Finding**: /work → /test → /review_pr occurs 23 times (92% of workflows)
**Opportunity**: Create combined workflow command
**Time Savings Potential**: 5 min × 23 = 115 min/month
**Confidence**: High (95%)

#### PATTERN #2: Security-Then-Test Correlation
**Finding**: When security-analyst runs, test-specialist follows 87% of time
**Opportunity**: Auto-invoke both in parallel (saves 8 min)
**Time Savings Potential**: 8 min × 12 = 96 min/month
**Confidence**: High (92%)

#### PATTERN #3: Auth Bug Clustering
**Finding**: 5 auth-related bugs in 6 weeks (unusual spike)
**Opportunity**: Create auth-specific validator
**Risk Prevention**: High (prevents outages)
**Confidence**: Medium (78%)

### Workflow Optimizations Identified
1. ✅ Parallel agent execution (security + test)
2. ⏳ Auto-cleanup after refactoring
3. ⏳ Pre-commit validation for auth changes

### Time Analysis
- **Fastest command**: /test (avg 3.2 min)
- **Slowest command**: /work (avg 18.5 min)
- **Bottleneck**: Manual security reviews (add automation)

### Agent Performance
- **Most invoked**: test-specialist (62 times)
- **Best success rate**: security-analyst (96%)
- **Needs improvement**: code-cleanup-specialist (74% - candidate for evolution)

### Recommendations
1. → Run /meta_learn to see specific suggestions
2. → Consider evolving code-cleanup-specialist
3. → Review auth security pattern (run /meta_predict)
```

**Options**:
- `--since <timeframe>`: Analyze specific period (7d, 30d, 90d)
- `--command <name>`: Focus on specific command
- `--detailed`: Include graphs and deep analysis

**→ TIMEFRAME**: Within 3 months
**→ SEVERITY**: High (production outage risk)

**→ EVIDENCE**:
  - Auth code changed 7 times in last 30 days (3x normal rate)
  - 4 PRs merged without security review (57% vs baseline 12%)
  - Similar pattern to Issue #213 (June 2024 auth bypass bug)
  - Code complexity in auth module increased 45% (above threshold)
  - No security tests added despite new features

**→ SIMILAR HISTORICAL INCIDENTS**:
  - Issue #213 (2024-06): Auth bypass - 60 hours to fix
  - Issue #189 (2024-03): Session leak - 40 hours to fix
  - Pattern match: 87% similar

**→ PREVENTIVE ACTIONS** (auto-generated):
  1. ✅ [AUTO-APPLIED] Add security gate to auth code changes
  2. ⏳ [PENDING] Schedule security audit of auth module
  3. ⏳ [PENDING] Expand test coverage: 40% → 90%
  4. ⏳ [PENDING] Add pre-commit hook for auth pattern violations

**→ ESTIMATED COST IF NOT PREVENTED**:
  - Development time: 40-80 hours debugging
  - Production impact: 2-4 hour outage
  - User trust impact: High
  - Financial: $15,000-30,000 (based on past incidents)

**→ PREVENTION COST**: 8 hours (ROI = 5-10x)

**→ NEXT ACTION**: Run `/meta_implement auth-security-gate`

---

### 🟡 MEDIUM CONFIDENCE PREDICTIONS (60-79%)

#### PREDICTION #2: Database Performance Degradation

### Changes Detected

#### BUG FIX: PR #347 - UTF-8 Null Byte Issue
**Commit**: abc1234
**Files**: lib/utils/text-sanitizer.ts
**Pattern**: Database text validation

**Auto-Generated Documentation**:

1. **New Pattern Doc**: `docs/patterns/database-safe-text.md`
```markdown
# Database-Safe Text Pattern

## Problem
PostgreSQL TEXT columns reject null bytes (\0), causing crashes

## Solution
Always sanitize text before database writes:
\`\`\`typescript
function sanitizeForDB(text: string): string {
  return text.replace(/\0/g, '')
}
\`\`\`

## Test
\`\`\`typescript
test('removes null bytes', () => {
  expect(sanitizeForDB('text\0byte')).toBe('textbyte')
})
\`\`\`

## Related Issues
- #347 - UTF-8 null byte crash
\`\`\`

2. **Updated**: `CLAUDE.md`
   - Added anti-pattern: "Never write unsanitized text to database"
   - Added validation requirement for all text inputs

3. **Created**: `lib/validation/text-validator.ts`
   - Auto-generated validator from pattern
   - Ready to use in codebase

4. **Updated**: `agents/document-validator.md`
   - Added UTF-8 null byte check to checklist
   - Included in pre-commit validation

**When to use it**:
- Testing uncertain improvements (confidence < 80%)
- Trying new agent configurations
- Validating risky changes
- Learning which approaches work best

**Difficulty**: 🔴 Advanced (for experienced users)

**How to use it**:

```bash
# Create new experiment
/meta_experiment create "Parallel agent invocation saves time"

# List active experiments
/meta_experiment list

# Check experiment results
/meta_experiment results exp-001

# Promote successful experiment
/meta_experiment promote exp-001
```

**Sample Workflow**:

**Step 1: Create Experiment**
```bash
/meta_experiment create "Test parallel PR review agents"
```

Output:
```markdown
## EXPERIMENT CREATED: exp-2025-10-20-001

**Hypothesis**: Running security-analyst + code-cleanup in parallel saves 15+ minutes
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: Active (collecting data)

**Design**:
- Control group: Sequential (current behavior)
- Treatment group: Parallel execution
- Sample size needed: 10 trials each
- Success criteria: >15 min time savings with p < 0.05

**What happens next**:
- System will randomly assign 50% of PR reviews to each group
- Metrics tracked: time, success rate, issues found
- After 20 trials, statistical analysis runs
- If successful (p<0.05, improvement>threshold): auto-promote
- If failed or neutral: auto-rollback

**Monitor**: `/meta_experiment results exp-2025-10-20-001`
```

**Step 2: Let It Run** (Automatic)

System runs trials automatically:
- PR #457: Control (sequential) - 45 min
- PR #458: Treatment (parallel) - 28 min
- PR #459: Control (sequential) - 43 min
- PR #460: Treatment (parallel) - 25 min
- ... continues until 20 trials

**Step 3: Check Results**

## Agents Reference

### Overview of Agents

| Agent | Purpose | Auto-Invoked By | Best For |
|-------|---------|-----------------|----------|
| meta-orchestrator | Coordinates other agents | All meta commands | Complex multi-agent tasks |
| code-cleanup-specialist | Finds dead code | Refactoring tasks | Removing unused code |
| pr-review-responder | Handles review feedback | `/review_pr` | Multiple reviewers |
| document-validator | Validates data | Database writes | UTF-8, encoding issues |
| breaking-change-validator | Prevents breaking changes | Deletions | Before removing code |

---

### meta-orchestrator - The Workflow Coordinator

**What it does**: Learns which combinations of agents work best together and automatically orchestrates them.

**Think of it as**: A project manager who knows which specialists to assign to each type of task.

**When it's invoked**:
- Automatically by meta commands
- When you have a complex task requiring multiple agents
- When patterns suggest multi-agent workflows

**What problems it solves**:
- **Inefficient agent usage**: Prevents running wrong agents or running them sequentially when parallel would be faster
- **Missing agents**: Ensures all necessary agents are invoked
- **Time waste**: Optimizes agent execution order to save time

**Real-world example**:

**Before meta-orchestrator**:
```bash
# You manually run agents one by one
Task security-analyst "Review auth code"
# Wait 8 minutes...
Task test-specialist "Test auth code"
# Wait 7 minutes...
# Total: 15 minutes
```

**After meta-orchestrator learns**:
```bash
# You run a meta command
/work 347  # Auth-related issue

# meta-orchestrator automatically:
# - Detects this is a security issue (auth/ files)
# - Invokes security-analyst + test-specialist in PARALLEL
# - Saves 8 minutes (runs in 8 min vs 15 min)
```

**How it learns**:

Week 1-2: Observes which agents you invoke for different tasks
Week 3-4: Identifies patterns ("security issues always need security-analyst + test-specialist")
Week 5+: Auto-invokes optimal agent combinations

**Workflow Graph Example**:

After learning, it builds a map:

```
Task Type: Security Bug Fix
├─ Parallel Phase: security-analyst + test-specialist (8 min)
├─ Sequential: backend-specialist (10 min after analysis)
└─ Sequential: document-validator (5 min after implementation)

Total: 23 min (vs 31 min if sequential)
Success Rate: 95% (based on 34 past tasks)
```

### code-cleanup-specialist - The Declutterer

**What it does**: Automatically finds and removes unused code, orphaned imports, and dead dependencies.

**Think of it as**: A professional organizer for your codebase.

**When it's invoked**:
- During refactoring tasks
- By `/clean_branch` command
- Monthly cleanup reviews
- Before major releases

**What problems it solves**:
- **Dead code accumulation**: Codebase grows with unused functions, imports, components
- **Manual cleanup is slow**: Finding all unused code manually takes hours
- **Fear of deletion**: Not sure if code is truly unused

**Real-world example**:

**Before**:
```bash
# You spend 2 hours manually:
# - Searching for unused imports across 50 files
# - Checking if functions are referenced
# - Testing after each deletion
# - Hoping you didn't break anything
```

**After**:
```bash
# You run the agent
Task code-cleanup-specialist "Clean up authentication module"

# Agent automatically:
# ✓ Scans 50 files in auth/ directory
# ✓ Finds 23 unused imports
# ✓ Identifies 5 unused functions (0 references)
# ✓ Detects 2 orphaned files
# ✓ Removes everything safely
# ✓ Runs tests to verify nothing broke
# ✓ Creates organized PR with changes

# Time: 15 minutes (vs 2 hours manual)
```

**What it finds**:
- ✅ Unused imports: `import { unusedFunction } from './utils'`
- ✅ Unused functions: `export function oldHelper() { ... }` (0 references)
- ✅ Dead components: `UserProfile.tsx` (never imported)
- ✅ Unused packages: `lodash` in package.json but never imported
- ✅ Commented code: `// function oldCode() { ... }`

**Safety features**:
- Tests code before deletion
- Creates incremental commits (easy to revert)
- Shows you exactly what will be removed (dry-run mode)
- Only removes high-confidence dead code

---

### pr-review-responder - The Review Aggregator

**What it does**: Collects feedback from multiple reviewers (humans + AI), deduplicates it, and creates organized response plans.

**Think of it as**: An executive assistant who consolidates feedback from 5 different people into one actionable list.

**When it's invoked**:
- By `/review_pr` command
- When PR has comments from multiple reviewers
- When you have conflicting feedback

**What problems it solves**:
- **Review overload**: 3 humans + 2 AI reviewers = 50+ comments to process
- **Duplicate feedback**: 3 people say the same thing in different words
- **Conflicting advice**: One says "use JWT", another says "use sessions"
- **Priority confusion**: What to fix first?

**Real-world example**:

**Before**:
```
PR #123 has feedback from:
- Senior Dev (8 comments)
- Security Team (12 comments)
- Claude Code Review (15 comments)
- Gemini Review (9 comments)
- QA Team (6 comments)

Total: 50 comments to read, understand, deduplicate, prioritize, and respond to
Time: 60-90 minutes
```

**After**:
```bash
Task pr-review-responder "Process PR #123 feedback"

# Agent automatically:
# ✓ Fetches all 50 comments
# ✓ Deduplicates: "SQL injection" mentioned by 3 reviewers → 1 issue
# ✓ Categorizes: 3 critical, 7 high priority, 15 medium, 25 low
# ✓ Creates action plan with time estimates
# ✓ Drafts personalized responses to each reviewer
# ✓ Generates checklist for implementation

# Output: Organized plan with 18 unique issues (from 50 comments)
# Time: 5 minutes to generate, 10 minutes to review = 15 min total
# Savings: 45-75 minutes
```

**Sample output**:

```markdown
## PR #123 Review Response Plan

**Total Feedback**: 50 comments → **18 unique issues** (after deduplication)

### P0 - Critical (Must Fix) [3 items]
1. SQL injection (flagged by Senior Dev, Claude, Security Team)
2. Missing rate limiting (Security Team)
3. Passwords not hashed (Gemini, Security Team)

### P1 - High Priority [7 items]

### document-validator - The Data Guardian

**What it does**: Validates data at system boundaries to prevent encoding errors, database crashes, and data corruption.

**Think of it as**: A TSA security checkpoint for your data—catches dangerous stuff before it gets in.

**When it's invoked**:
- Before database writes
- When processing uploaded files
- During data exports (CSV, PDF)
- By `/meta_document` for validation

**What problems it solves**:
- **UTF-8 null byte crashes**: PostgreSQL rejects `\0`, app crashes
- **Encoding issues**: Invalid UTF-8 from PDFs breaks parser
- **String length violations**: User enters 300-char name, DB allows 100
- **Emoji problems**: 💀 breaks old MySQL databases
- **CSV export failures**: Newlines in data break CSV format

**Real-world example**:

**The UTF-8 Null Byte Bug** (real incident):

```
Timeline:
1. User uploads PDF with null byte in text
2. App extracts text: "Hello\0World"
3. App tries to save to database
4. PostgreSQL rejects null byte → 500 error
5. Production down for 40 minutes
6. 4 hours to debug and fix

Cost: 4.5 hours developer time + user impact
```

**With document-validator**:

```bash
# Agent automatically detects the pattern:
# - 3 UTF-8 bugs in 2 months
# - All involve: PDF → extract → database
# - All fail on null bytes

# Agent generates solution:
1. ✓ Creates sanitizer: removes null bytes before DB write
2. ✓ Adds validation: checks all text inputs
3. ✓ Generates tests: 23 edge cases (emoji, null bytes, long strings)
4. ✓ Updates CLAUDE.md: documents the pattern
5. ✓ Creates ESLint rule: prevents future violations

# Result: Bug prevented automatically in future
```

**What it validates**:

| Boundary | What It Checks | Example |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| File uploads | Encoding, null bytes | PDF → UTF-8 validation |
| API inputs | Length, format | Email ≤ 255 chars |
| Database writes | Constraints, encoding | No `\0` in TEXT columns |
| Data exports | Escaping, format | Quotes in CSV → `""` |

**Automatic fixes it generates**:
```typescript
// Auto-generated by document-validator
export function sanitizeForDatabase(text: string): string {
  return text
    .replace(/\0/g, '')      // Remove null bytes
    .trim()                   // Remove whitespace
    .normalize('NFC')         // Normalize Unicode
}
```

### breaking-change-validator - The Safety Inspector

**What it does**: Analyzes dependencies before you delete code, ensuring you don't break anything.

**Think of it as**: A building inspector who checks if removing a support beam will make the house collapse.

**When it's invoked**:
- Before file deletions
- Before API endpoint removal
- Before database column drops
- During refactoring

**What problems it solves**:
- **Accidental breakage**: Delete file → 5 other files import it → production broken
- **Unknown dependencies**: Don't realize old API is used by mobile app
- **Database disasters**: Drop column → app crashes because queries still reference it
- **Time wasted**: Hours fixing what should have been prevented

**Real-world example**:

**The Almost-Disaster**:

```bash
# Developer: "This oldParser.ts file looks unused, let's delete it"

$ rm src/utils/oldParser.ts
$ git commit -m "Remove old parser"
$ git push
```

**What would have happened**:
```
Build: ❌ FAILED
src/api/documents.ts:5 - Error: Cannot find module '../utils/oldParser'
src/services/import.ts:12 - Error: Cannot find module '../utils/oldParser'
tests/parser.test.ts:3 - Error: Cannot find module '../utils/oldParser'

Production impact:
- Document upload feature completely broken
- Import service crashes
- 5 tests failing

Time to fix: 2-4 hours (revert + implement new parser)
```

**With breaking-change-validator**:

```bash
# You run before deleting
Task breaking-change-validator "Check if I can delete src/utils/oldParser.ts"

# Agent output:
```markdown
## ⚠️ CANNOT DELETE - Migration Required

**File**: src/utils/oldParser.ts
**Dependencies Found**: 3 direct, 2 indirect
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM-HIGH

### Direct Dependencies
1. src/api/documents.ts:5 - imports `parse`
2. src/services/import.ts:12 - imports `parseDocument`
3. tests/parser.test.ts:3 - test imports

### Indirect Dependencies
- Production API: /api/documents/upload (users affected)
- Frontend: DocumentUpload.tsx component

### Recommended Action: DO NOT DELETE

**Instead, follow migration plan**:
1. Implement new parser (2 hours)
2. Migrate 3 dependencies (1.5 hours)
3. Update tests (1 hour)
4. Deploy and verify (30 min)
5. Wait 1 release cycle
6. THEN delete old parser

**Estimated time**: 5 hours (vs 2-4 hours fixing after breaking)
```

**What it checks**:

For **file deletions**:
- All imports of the file
- Dynamic imports
- Re-exports from other files

For **API deletions**:
- Frontend usage (fetch, axios calls)
- Mobile app usage
- Documentation references
- External integrations

For **database deletions**:
- Code references to column/table
- SQL queries
- Foreign key constraints
- Data existence

**Migration checklists it generates**:

```markdown
## Migration Checklist

### Phase 1: Preparation
- [ ] Create branch
- [ ] Document current behavior
- [ ] Identify replacement

### Phase 2: Implementation

## Common Workflows

### Weekly Routine (15 minutes)

**Goal**: Keep the meta-learning system running smoothly and implementing improvements.

**Monday Morning Routine**:

```bash
# 1. Run the weekly improvement pipeline (automatic)
/meta_improve

# Expected: Creates PR with improvements
# Time: 15-20 min (runs in background)

# 2. Check your email/terminal for summary
# Shows: What was improved, experiments started, agents evolved

# 3. Review the PR (5 minutes)
gh pr list  # Find the meta-learning PR

gh pr view 462  # Review changes

# 4. Merge if tests pass (1 minute)
gh pr merge 462

# Total time: ~20 minutes
# Benefit: 15-40 hours saved this month
```

**What `/meta_improve` does for you**:
- ✅ Analyzes last week's patterns
- ✅ Generates improvement suggestions
- ✅ Auto-implements high-confidence improvements
- ✅ Creates experiments for uncertain ideas
- ✅ Evolves agents to be smarter
- ✅ Updates documentation
- ✅ Creates PR for your review

### Monthly Deep Dive (30 minutes)

**Goal**: Review system health, predictions, and plan next month.

**First Monday of Month**:

```bash
# 1. Full analysis (5 minutes)
/meta_analyze --since 30d --detailed

# Review output: patterns, bottlenecks, opportunities

# 2. Check predictions (5 minutes)
/meta_predict --horizon 60d

# Review: Any high-confidence warnings?
# Action: Create issues for preventive work

# 3. Health dashboard (5 minutes)
/meta_health --dashboard

# Review metrics:
# - Developer velocity trend
# - Time saved
# - Agent performance
# - Prediction accuracy

# 4. Plan improvements (10 minutes)
/meta_learn --with-history

# Review suggestions not yet implemented
# Decide which to implement this month

# 5. Update tracking (5 minutes)
# Create issues for:
# - High-priority predictions
# - High-ROI suggestions
# - Agent improvements needed
```

**Quarterly Review** (1 hour):

Every 3 months, assess ROI:

```bash
# Generate comprehensive report
/meta_health --dashboard --since 90d --output quarterly-report.md

# Review:
# - Total time saved (goal: 40+ hours)
# - Bugs prevented (goal: 10+)
# - Agent improvements (goal: 20-30% better)
# - Documentation accuracy (goal: >95%)
# - Developer velocity (goal: 2x+ baseline)
```

### Responding to Suggestions

**When `/meta_learn` shows a suggestion**:

**Step 1: Evaluate** (2 minutes)
```
Review:
- ✅ Does this make sense?
- ✅ Is the ROI worth it?
- ✅ Do I trust the confidence level?
- ✅ Are there any risks?
```

**Step 2: Decide**

**High confidence + High ROI** → Auto-implement:
```bash
/meta_implement suggestion-1 --dry-run  # Check first
/meta_implement suggestion-1  # Apply
```

**Medium confidence** → Experiment:
```bash
/meta_experiment create "Test this suggestion"
# Let it run for 2 weeks
# System will auto-promote if successful
```

**Low confidence or unsure** → Defer:
```
Do nothing. Wait for more data.
System will re-evaluate next week with more evidence.
```

**Doesn't make sense** → Reject:
```
Ignore the suggestion.
Eventually it will be pruned from the system.
```

### Working with psd-claude-workflow Plugin

**If you have both plugins installed**:

They work together seamlessly:

```bash
# Your normal workflow command
/work 347

# Behind the scenes:
# 1. psd-claude-workflow executes the work
# 2. psd-claude-meta-learning-system observes:
#    - Which agents were used
#    - How long it took
#    - What files changed
#    - Success/failure
# 3. Patterns accumulate in telemetry

# After a week:
/meta_analyze

# Shows:
# - /work is most-used command
# - Average duration: 18.5 min
# - Success rate: 94%
# - Usually followed by /test

# Suggests:
# "Create /work_with_tests command to save 3 min per task"
```

**Best practice**: Let meta-learning observe for 2-4 weeks before making changes to workflow commands.

## Understanding Your Data

### Where Data Is Stored

All meta-learning data lives in:
```
plugins/psd-claude-meta-learning-system/meta/
├── telemetry.json           # Command execution logs
├── workflow_graph.json      # Agent orchestration patterns
├── compound_history.json    # Improvement suggestions & outcomes
├── experiments.json         # A/B test data
├── agent_variants.json      # Agent evolution history
└── predictions.json         # Predictive analysis data
```

**Important**: This directory is **Git-ignored by default**. Your usage data never gets committed to version control.

### What's in telemetry.json

**Sample entry**:
```json
{
  "executions": [
    {
      "id": "exec-2025-10-20-001",
      "command": "/work",
      "issue_number": 347,
      "timestamp": "2025-10-20T10:30:00Z",
      "duration_seconds": 720,
      "success": true,
      "agents_invoked": ["backend-specialist", "test-specialist"],
      "parallel_execution": false,
      "files_changed": 8,
      "tests_added": 12,
      "outcome_notes": "Implemented auth validation"
    }
  ]
}
```

**What's collected**: ✅
- Command name
- Duration
- Success/failure
- Agents used
- File count (not file names or content)
- Test count

**What's NOT collected**: ❌
- Your actual code
- File contents
- Issue descriptions
- Personal information
- API keys or secrets

### Automatic Telemetry from Workflow Commands

When you have both `psd-claude-workflow` and `psd-claude-meta-learning-system` plugins installed, telemetry is automatically collected from all workflow commands and agents **with zero configuration required**.

**How it works**:

1. **Workflow commands detect the meta-learning plugin** automatically (no manual setup)
2. **Each command initializes a telemetry session** at the start (Phase 0)
3. **Agents report their invocation** to the parent command's session
4. **Commands collect metadata** (files changed, tests added, etc.) during execution
5. **Session is finalized** at command completion and written to `telemetry.json`

**Example workflow**:
```bash
# You run a normal workflow command
/work 347

# Behind the scenes:
# ✓ Command detects meta-learning plugin installed
# ✓ Creates telemetry session: exec-2025-10-20-001
# ✓ Tracks: start time, command="/work", arguments="347"
# ✓ When backend-specialist invoked → adds to agents_invoked
# ✓ When test-specialist invoked → adds to agents_invoked
# ✓ Collects: files_changed=8, tests_added=12
# ✓ Finalizes: success=true, duration=720 seconds
# ✓ Appends to meta/telemetry.json
```

**Graceful degradation**:
- If meta-learning plugin NOT installed → commands work perfectly, no errors
- If telemetry disabled in config → commands skip telemetry, still work normally
- If meta directory doesn't exist → automatically created on first use

**No action required from you** - just install both plugins and telemetry happens automatically!

### Privacy & Security

**Local Only**:
- All data stays on your computer
- Nothing sent to external servers
- Nothing included in git commits

**What you can do**:

**View your data**:
```bash
cat plugins/psd-claude-meta-learning-system/meta/telemetry.json | jq .
```

**Clear your data**:
```bash
rm -rf plugins/psd-claude-meta-learning-system/meta/*.json
# System will start fresh
```

**Opt-out of telemetry**:
```bash
# Option 1: Don't install the plugin
/plugin uninstall psd-claude-meta-learning-system

# Option 2: Keep plugin but disable telemetry
# Edit: plugins/psd-claude-meta-learning-system/.claude-plugin/plugin.json
# Set: "telemetry_enabled": false
```

**Export your data**:
```bash
# For analysis or backup
cp -r plugins/psd-claude-meta-learning-system/meta ~/backups/meta-learning-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

### How to Read the Data

**View patterns**:
```bash
/meta_analyze --output analysis.md
# Creates readable markdown report
```

**View suggestions**:
```bash
/meta_learn --output suggestions.md
# Creates report of all suggestions
```

**View health**:
```bash
/meta_health --dashboard --output dashboard.md
# Creates comprehensive health report
```

**Raw JSON** (for programmers):
```bash
# Install jq for JSON viewing
brew install jq  # macOS
apt install jq   # Linux

# View telemetry
cat meta/telemetry.json | jq '.executions | length'  # Count events
cat meta/telemetry.json | jq '.patterns'  # View patterns
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Commands Not Working

**Problem**: `/meta_analyze` says "command not found"

**Solutions**:

1. **Check plugin is installed**:
```bash
/plugin list
# Should show: psd-claude-meta-learning-system
```

2. **Reinstall if missing**:
```bash
/plugin install psd-claude-meta-learning-system
```

3. **Check plugin is enabled**:
```bash
/plugin info psd-claude-meta-learning-system
# Should show: Status: Enabled
```

4. **Re-enable if disabled**:
```bash
/plugin enable psd-claude-meta-learning-system
```

### No Patterns Detected

**Problem**: `/meta_analyze` says "No patterns detected" or "Need more data"

**Cause**: Not enough usage data yet

**Solutions**:

1. **Keep using Claude Code normally** - System needs 2-4 weeks of data

2. **Check telemetry is collecting**:
```bash
/meta_health
# Should show: Events Collected: > 0
```

3. **If events = 0, telemetry might be disabled**:
```bash
# Check plugin config
cat plugins/psd-claude-meta-learning-system/.claude-plugin/plugin.json
# Look for: "telemetry_enabled": true
```

4. **Minimum data requirements**:
   - At least 20-30 command executions
   - At least 7 days of usage
   - At least 3 different commands used

**Timeline**:
- Week 1: Collecting data...
- Week 2: Early patterns (low confidence)
- Week 3-4: Good patterns (medium confidence)
- Month 2+: High confidence patterns

### Suggestions Seem Wrong

**Problem**: `/meta_learn` suggests things that don't make sense

**Possible Reasons**:

1. **Not enough data** → Wait for more usage
2. **Unusual workflow** → System is still learning your patterns
3. **Edge case detected** → Ignore low-confidence suggestions

**What to do**:

**Check confidence levels**:
```bash
/meta_learn --min-confidence 0.80
# Only show high-confidence suggestions (>80%)
```

**Reject bad suggestions**:
- Just don't implement them
- System will learn they're not useful
- Focus on high-confidence (>85%) suggestions

**Provide feedback** (manual):
```bash
# Edit: meta/compound_history.json
# Find the suggestion
# Add: "user_rejected": true, "reason": "Doesn't fit workflow"
```

### Performance Issues

**Problem**: Meta commands run slowly

**Causes & Solutions**:

1. **Large telemetry file**:
```bash
# Check size
du -h meta/telemetry.json

# If >10MB, archive old data
cd meta/
jq '.executions |= .[-1000:]' telemetry.json > telemetry-trimmed.json
mv telemetry-trimmed.json telemetry.json
```

2. **Too many agent variants**:
```bash
# Check variants
cat meta/agent_variants.json | jq '.variants | length'

# If >50, prune old ones (keep best 10 per agent)
/meta_evolve --prune-variants
```

3. **Disable features you don't use**:
```bash
# If not using experiments:
/meta_experiment --disable

# If not using predictions:
# Edit config, set: "predictions_enabled": false
```

### How to Report Bugs

**Before reporting**:

1. Check `/meta_health` - shows any system issues
2. Review this troubleshooting section
3. Try reinstalling the plugin

**To report a bug**:

```bash
# 1. Collect diagnostic info
/meta_health --output bug-report.md

# 2. Describe the issue
# - What command you ran
# - What you expected
# - What actually happened
# - Error messages (if any)

# 3. Open GitHub issue
gh issue create --repo psd401/psd-claude-coding-system \
  --title "meta-learning: [brief description]" \
  --body "$(cat bug-report.md)"
```

**Contact**:
- GitHub Issues: https://github.com/psd401/psd-claude-coding-system/issues
- Email: hagelk@psd401.net

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is my code being sent anywhere?

**No.** All data stays 100% local on your machine.

- ✅ Telemetry stored locally in `meta/` folder
- ✅ Git-ignored by default (never committed)
- ✅ No network requests to external servers
- ✅ No code content collected (only metadata like "8 files changed")

You can verify by checking:
```bash
# No network traffic from meta commands
/meta_analyze  # Monitor network - zero external requests
```

### How long until I see results?

**Timeline**:

- **Week 1-2**: Collecting data, no suggestions yet
- **Week 3-4**: First low-confidence suggestions appear
- **Month 2**: High-confidence suggestions, first improvements
- **Month 3**: Noticeable time savings, better agents
- **Month 6**: Significant productivity gains (2-3x baseline)

**First visible benefit**: Usually week 3-4 when you get your first good suggestion.

### Can I use this with psd-claude-workflow plugin?

**Yes!** They're designed to work together.

**How it works**:
- `psd-claude-workflow`: Does the actual development work
- `psd-claude-meta-learning-system`: Observes and improves workflows

**Installation**:
```bash
# Install both
/plugin install psd-claude-workflow
/plugin install psd-claude-meta-learning-system

# Use workflow commands normally
/work 347

# Meta-learning observes in background
# After 2-4 weeks, suggests workflow improvements
```

**Recommendation**: Install workflow first, use it for 2 weeks, then install meta-learning.

### Will this break my code?

**No.** Multiple safety mechanisms prevent breakage:

1. **Dry-run mode**: Always test before applying
```bash
/meta_implement suggestion-1 --dry-run  # Safe preview
```

2. **PR review**: Changes go through pull request (you review before merge)

3. **Automatic testing**: Runs tests before applying changes

4. **Easy rollback**: Every change is a git commit
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>  # Undo any change
```

5. **Backups**: Creates backup before making changes

6. **Human approval**: High-impact changes require your explicit approval

**Worst case**: You reject a PR, nothing changes.

### Can I disable telemetry?

**Yes.** Several options:

**Option 1: Don't install the plugin**
```bash
# Just use psd-claude-workflow without meta-learning
/plugin install psd-claude-workflow  # Only this one
```

**Option 2: Disable telemetry but keep commands**
```bash
# Edit config
vi plugins/psd-claude-meta-learning-system/.claude-plugin/plugin.json

# Set:
{
  "telemetry_enabled": false
}
```

**Option 3: Clear data regularly**
```bash
# Weekly/monthly:
rm meta/telemetry.json
# System starts fresh
```

**Note**: Without telemetry, the system can't learn or make suggestions. You'll still have access to commands but they won't have learned patterns.

### How much does this cost?

**Plugin**: Free (open source)

**Claude API usage**: You pay normal Claude Code costs

**Approximate costs**:
- `/meta_analyze`: ~$0.10 per run (reads telemetry)
- `/meta_learn`: ~$0.15 per run (generates suggestions)
- `/meta_implement`: ~$0.05 per implementation
- `/meta_evolve`: ~$0.30 per agent evolution

**Weekly pipeline** (`/meta_improve`): ~$0.60

**Monthly total**: $3-5 typically

**ROI**: If you save 15+ hours per month, this pays for itself many times over.

### What if I don't like a suggestion?

**Just don't implement it.** No penalty.

**Process**:
1. `/meta_learn` shows suggestion
2. You review it
3. You decide:
   - ✅ Good → implement it
   - ❌ Bad → ignore it
   - 🤔 Unsure → wait for more data

**The system learns**:
- Tracks which suggestions you implement vs ignore
- Adjusts future suggestions based on your preferences
- Eventually stops suggesting similar things you always reject

**You're always in control.** The system suggests, you decide.

### Can I customize what gets learned?

**Yes.** Several customization options:

**Focus on specific commands**:
```bash
/meta_analyze --command /work
/meta_learn --category workflow
```

**Adjust confidence thresholds**:
```bash
# Only see high-confidence suggestions
/meta_learn --min-confidence 0.85
```

**Disable specific features**:
```bash
# Skip predictions if you don't use them
# Edit config: "predictions_enabled": false

# Skip agent evolution
/meta_improve --skip-evolve
```

**Custom patterns** (advanced):
```bash
# Manually add patterns to workflow_graph.json
# System will incorporate them into learning
```

### Is this production-ready?

**Status**: 🧪 **Experimental** (v0.1.0)

**What this means**:

**Works well**:
- ✅ Telemetry collection
- ✅ Pattern analysis
- ✅ Suggestion generation
- ✅ Basic agent evolution

**Still improving**:
- ⏳ Prediction accuracy (currently ~70%, target 85%+)
- ⏳ Agent evolution effectiveness (varies by agent)
- ⏳ Auto-implementation safety (conservative by design)

**Safe for**:
- ✅ Personal projects
- ✅ Development environments
- ✅ Small teams
- ✅ Learning/experimentation

**Use caution for**:
- ⚠️  Critical production systems (review all changes carefully)
- ⚠️  Large teams (coordinate usage)
- ⚠️  Regulated environments (check compliance)

**Recommendation**: Start with personal projects, gain confidence, then expand usage.

### How is this different from GitHub Copilot?

**Different purposes**:

| Feature | GitHub Copilot | Meta-Learning System |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Purpose** | Code completion | Workflow optimization |
| **What it does** | Suggests next line of code | Suggests process improvements |
| **When it helps** | While typing | Between tasks |
| **Learning** | From public code | From YOUR workflow |
| **Output** | Code snippets | Automation & patterns |
| **Scope** | Individual files | Entire workflow |

**Example**:

**Copilot**: "You're writing a function, here's the next line"
**Meta-Learning**: "You always test after refactoring—let me automate that"

**Use both together**:
- Copilot: Helps you write code faster
- Meta-Learning: Helps you work smarter

### What data does this collect?

**Collected** ✅:
- Command names (`/work`, `/test`, etc.)
- Timestamps (when commands ran)
- Durations (how long they took)
- Success/failure status
- Agent names used
- File counts (how many files changed)
- Test counts (how many tests added)

**NOT collected** ❌:
- Actual code content
- File names or paths
- Issue descriptions or titles
- Commit messages
- Personal information
- API keys or secrets
- Anything outside Claude Code commands

**Example collected**:
```json
{
  "command": "/work",
  "duration": 720,
  "success": true,
  "agents": ["backend-specialist"],
  "files_changed": 8
}
```

**What you never see in telemetry**:
- What files were changed (just the count: 8)
- What code was written
- What the issue was about

Record: Command → Duration → Success → Agents → Files
Store: In telemetry.json
```

**Phase 2: Pattern Recognition** (Weekly)
```
Algorithm:
1. Group similar events (same command, similar duration)
2. Find correlations (X always follows Y)
3. Calculate frequencies (95% of the time)
4. Identify anomalies (unusual patterns)
```

**Phase 3: Suggestion Generation** (Weekly)
```
For each pattern:
1. Estimate ROI (time saved × frequency)
2. Calculate confidence (sample size, consistency)
3. Generate implementation code
4. Rank by: ROI × Confidence
```

**Phase 4: Learning from Outcomes** (Continuous)
```
Track:
- Which suggestions were implemented
- Did they actually save time?
- Were they kept or reverted?
- User satisfaction

Adjust:
- Confidence thresholds
- Pattern weights
- Suggestion prioritization
```

**Phase 5: Agent Evolution** (Monthly)
```
Genetic Algorithm:
1. Generate 5 mutations of agent prompt
2. Test each on 50 historical tasks
3. Score: Success rate + Quality - False positives
4. Keep top 2, breed 3 new variants
5. Repeat 5-10 generations
6. Promote best variant
```

**The key**: System learns not just from what you do, but from what works and what doesn't.

## Summary

The **PSD Claude Meta-Learning System** is an experimental plugin that watches how you work, learns your patterns, and automatically suggests improvements. Think of it as having an experienced developer on your team who's always looking for ways to make your workflow more efficient.

**Get Started**:
1. Install the plugin
2. Use Claude Code normally for 2-4 weeks
3. Run `/meta_improve` weekly
4. Review and merge the PRs it creates
5. Watch your productivity compound over time

**Support**:
- Documentation: This README
- Issues: https://github.com/psd401/psd-claude-coding-system/issues
- Email: hagelk@psd401.net

**Remember**: This is a learning system. It gets smarter the more you use it. Be patient in the first month, and you'll see compound benefits starting in month 2-3.

Happy coding! 🚀
