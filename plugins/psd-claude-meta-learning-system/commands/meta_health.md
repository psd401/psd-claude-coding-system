# Meta Health Command

Generate a comprehensive health dashboard showing system performance and compound improvements.

## What This Does

Creates a health report with:
- Self-improvement statistics
- Developer velocity metrics
- System intelligence indicators
- Code quality trends
- Active experiments status
- Predictions validation
- ROI summary

## Usage

```bash
# Generate health report
/meta_health

# Publish to dashboard
/meta_health --publish

# Send email summary
/meta_health --send-summary-email
```

## Metrics Tracked

**Compound Engineering**:
- Auto-improvements implemented
- Agent evolution progress
- Patterns documented
- Bugs prevented

**Developer Velocity**:
- Current vs baseline velocity
- Time saved this month
- Projected annual savings

**System Intelligence**:
- Agent performance improvements
- Workflow optimizations learned
- Prediction accuracy

**Code Quality**:
- Test coverage trends
- Technical debt direction
- Documentation accuracy
- Security issue prevention rate
